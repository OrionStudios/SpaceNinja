Townsperson
Our town thanks you!
Zave
Do you know anything about my uncle?
Townsperson
Ah, yes, Vledd.
Townsperson
Rumor has it that he was inhabiting an abandoned castle north of here, which seems to be the source of the dark magic.
Townsperson
It doesn't make any sense though. Vledd was born without magic.
Townsperson
If that's where you're headed though, you may want some intel first.
Townsperson
My friend Astra can help you.
