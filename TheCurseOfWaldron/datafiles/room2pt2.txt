"Do you know anything about the dark magic or the missing wizards?"
Townsperson

"I have an uncle? Why would he do something like that?"

Townsperson
"He left Zemira years ago, and no one knows what happened after he disappeared or why."
Townsperson
"But we don't have much time, whatever is happening must be stopped."
